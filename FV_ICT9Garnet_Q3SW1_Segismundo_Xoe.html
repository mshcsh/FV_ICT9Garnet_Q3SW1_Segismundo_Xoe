		<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
		<p>Possessing psychic abilities may appear advantageous to the average person; However, this is not the case at all for Kusuo Saiki. He believes that this so-called blessing is nothing more than a curse because he is endowed with a wide range of supernatural abilities, including telepathy and x-ray vision. Kusuo's only goal is a normal, hassle-free life in which ignorance is bliss, despite the constant inconveniences caused by his powers. Sadly, a psychic's life is far from tranquil. Even though Kusuo tries to keep his powers a secret from his classmates, he accidentally attracts the attention of a lot of strange people, like the empty-headed Riki Nendou and the liar Shun Kaidou. Kusuo discovers, as he is forced to deal with the craziness of those around him, that the normal life he has been striving for is much more difficult to achieve than he anticipated. </p>
